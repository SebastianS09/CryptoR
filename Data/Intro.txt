October 2008. An anonymous individual, by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, publishes a paper claiming that he had succeeded in creating what many had previously attempted in vain: a digital currency. Twelve years before, back in 1996, Douglas Jackson had managed to get as close as one could get by creating the e-gold system: everyone could anonymously open an account, send and receive the new “international money, independent of any State or Government”. By 2005, over 3.5 million people used e-gold in 165 countries, which thereby became the second largest way of transferring money through the Internet, after PayPal. Four years later, in 2009, the FBI had ceased all e-gold assets, as it had become the way hackers or fraudulent individuals operated anonymously on the Internet. Douglas Jackson, sentenced to 3 years in prison and to a $1.5m fine had accepted to regulate his new currency. Learning from Jackson’s error, Satoshi Nakamoto added two ingredients to his innovation: anonymity, and the technologic miracle of a decentralised system, i.e. impossible to decapitate. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, given the impacted image of banks and financial institutions, who had played with the people’s savings, the nascent Bitcoin represented the people’s money. No third party, no opacity, no domination of “vulture funds and Governments”. Back then, one Bitcoin was worth $0.11. In October 2017, it has exceeded $5,000, sign that a larger fringe of the population believes in the surprising technology. Some people call it a fraud, like Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan & Chase, the world’s largest investment bank. Other deeply believe that the blockchain technology is “more disruptive than the Internet itself”. Almost a decade after the emergence of this new technology and the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, amidst the ongoing hype and polemic, what conclusion can we draw regarding its impact on our world?
